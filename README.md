Hardware Turret (verilog source code)
#===== Project ======
We built a rotating turret with fire at arbitrary
precision positions within it's rotation arc.
- It loads in manunally inputted positions onto a stack
  (maximum size 8, stack is highly modular can be extended easily)
- Rotates in a semicircle shooting, shooting when it reaches a
  position that is on the stack
-
